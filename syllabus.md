### Classroom Expectations:
The Balcony Mac Lab is a district computer lab, and as such has some policies that are set by the district.

By the district, food and drink are not allowed. This includes candy and gum. Students may have a water bottle, but it needs to be resealable, and kept on the floor.

Every student is sitting at a new iMac with 16 gb of ram and a 21.5” screen. As such, students do not need and should not be using any additional devices without permission. This includes but is not limited to phones, tablets, and chrome books.

Specific homework is rarely given. As such, students are expected to be productive from the start of class, until the end. However, you are expected to interact with course content or concepts outside of class.
