# First-Page
My First GitHub page. I **really** don't know what I'm doing. ~~Hello, internet~~.
I hope anyone reading enjoys... Well as much as one can enjoy this. I don't know whether or not I will be doing assignments on this page in the future. If I am, I might need to change the name or make a new page. Though, I think changing the name would be much easier.
